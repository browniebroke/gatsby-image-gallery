Very basic gallery grid based on `gatsby-plugin-image` and `react-image-lightbox`, styling powered by `styled-components`.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save @browniebroke/gatsby-image-gallery
```

Note: this library is compatible with Gatbsy v3 and `gatsby-plugin-image` as of version 6.
If you want to use it with Gastby v2 and the `gatsby-image` plugin, please stick to version 5 or earlier.

## Usage

This library provides a `Gallery` component, rendering as a grid of images that can be clicked to open in full size inside a lightbox. See below for a minimal example:

```jsx
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'
import React from 'react'

import Gallery from '@browniebroke/gatsby-image-gallery'

const MyPage = ({ data }) => {
  const images = data.allFile.edges.map(({ node }) => node.childImageSharp)
  // `images` is an array of objects with `thumb` and `full`
  return <Gallery images={images} />
}

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query ImagesForGallery {
    allFile {
      edges {
        node {
          childImageSharp {
            thumb: gatsbyImageData(
              width: 270
              height: 270
              placeholder: BLURRED
            )
            full: gatsbyImageData(layout: FULL_WIDTH)
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`

export default MyPage
```

### The `images` prop

The `images` prop is an array of objects with 2 required properties: `thumb` and `full` that should each be a `GatsbyImage` compatible object.

In addition, images may have the following properties:

- `thumbAlt`: (string) used to set the `alt` attribute on the thumbnail image
- `title`: (node) passed to the Lightbox component as [`imageTitle`](https://github.com/frontend-collective/react-image-lightbox#options).
- `caption`: (node) passed to the Lightbox component as [`imageCaption`](https://github.com/frontend-collective/react-image-lightbox#options).

### Passing options to Lightbox

The `<Gallery>` component accepts an object in the `lightboxOptions` prop, which will be passed down directly [to `react-image-lightbox`](https://github.com/frontend-collective/react-image-lightbox).

You can see the full list of options in [their documentation](https://github.com/frontend-collective/react-image-lightbox#options).

### Passing `onClose` callback to Lightbox

The `<Gallery>` component accepts a function in the `onClose` prop, which will be called when [`react-image-lightbox`](https://github.com/frontend-collective/react-image-lightbox) is closed by the user.

### Customise columns

To customise the number of columns and the space between the images, you have several props:

- `colWidth`: percentage of total width to use on small screens (1/3 by default).
- `mdColWidth`: percentage of total width to use on medium and large screens (1/4 by default).
- `gutter`: margin around each image (0.25rem by default).
- `rowMargin`: horizontal margin on each side of the gallery (-15px by default)

### Customise image styles

You may also inject your own image styles by passing a component as `customWrapper` prop. The given component will be passed a single `GatbsyImage` as `children` prop, that you should render inside your custom component:

```jsx
const CustomWrapper = ({ children, onClick }) => (
  <div className="my-custom-image-wraper" onClick={onClick}>
    {children}
  </div>
)

const MyPage = ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <Gallery
      //... Other props omited for clarity
      customWrapper={CustomWrapper} // example of use
    />
  )
}
```

### Example

For a full working example, there is one in [the example folder](https://github.com/browniebroke/gatsby-image-gallery/tree/master/example) which is [deployed to Netlify](https://gatsby-image-gallery.netlify.app/).
